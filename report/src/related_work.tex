\section{Related Work}

A first work is \texttt{Short Tandem Repeats Forensics}. It details tools about the DNA sequencing of STR profiles that criminal DNA forensics relies heavily on. Those tools are STRait Razor (analysis of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) data from different marker systems, including STR), Illumina ForenSeq Software (software designed to support forensic genomic applications), and EuroForMix (can analyse complex DNA profiles with artefacts).

The second work is \texttt{Single Nucleotide Polymorphism DNA forensics}. Identifying multiple contributors of complex DNA mixtures can prove to be challenging, and can be facilitated by identifying less frequently occurring DNA bases\footnote{minor alleles} in panels of selected SNPs loci. Taking a panel of multiple SNP alleles, the more contributors of a complex DNA mixture can be identified the larger the panel of SNPs.
