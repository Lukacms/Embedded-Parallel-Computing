\section{Conclusion}

This paper shows an advancement for forensic scientists to identify people, should it be in the criminal forensic, or to more broadly identify kinship between people. And it is possible in complex DNA mixture containing more contributors. Using the pipeline and developed tools, the 12 contributors have been able to be identified.\  
The pipeline is able to be as scalable and as performant as it is thanks to parallel systems, both on the software and the hardware sides. The benchmark solutions and framework used for the GrigoraSNP tool allow parallel computing, which makes scalability nearly linear. Moreover, the two hardware components used have been designed to handle parallel computation thanks to number of CPU and threads.

Added to an automatic loading of results in the end-user platform (IdPrism), the SNP data analysis typically completes in about 7 minutes for 100 millions sequences, and can even run on a laptop.
