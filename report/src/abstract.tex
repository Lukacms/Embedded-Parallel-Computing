\section{Abstract}

The analysis of complex mixture of DNA and other advanced forensics capabilities have been made possible by the forensic calculation of SNPs. The paper describes a pipeline using multiples tools that runs in parallel, and enable performance and scalability of multiple samples.\
Illumina and Ion Torrent generate sequencing datasets that are fed to GrigoraSNPs to allele call the HTS sequences. The results of this operation are automatically loaded in the IdPrism for the end-users to visualize the DNA mixture analysis. The whole pipeline can run in about 7 min for 100 millions sequences.
